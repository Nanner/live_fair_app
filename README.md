# Live Fair

Consumer and trade fairs should be an opportunity to bring people closer to the companies that make their lives better. However, this is not always the case - complicated showrooms, coupled with large crowds and exhibition booths that lack in appeal often make people avoid interaction.

So, we bring you our Live Fair App - a mobile application that supports visitors, companies and organizers during these events, saving up time for what really matters: social interaction. Our main features include:
* Helpful overview of upcoming fairs, with interest and location based suggestions
* Detailed information about fairs, their event schedule and participating companies
* Interest-based matching between visitors and companies
* Helpful statistics for participating companies and fair organizers
* Comprehensive notifications about upcoming events

Keep it simple and never again get lost in a busy, cumbersome event. Let us guide you. Let us bring life to your fair.
